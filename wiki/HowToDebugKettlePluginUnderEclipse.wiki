#how to setup eclipse run/debug configuration in order to debug kettle plugins 

= How To Debug Kettle Plugin Under Eclipse - DRAFT =

Once you set up Kettle run/debug configuration under Eclipse you may want to debug plugin, for example this one ;) (sources for plugin have not been committed yet). This document is here for you then and for everybody else who suffers from lack of documentation for Kettle. 

In case you find any mistake or easier way how to debug plugins, let me know, please. 

= Details =

I assume you created run/debug configuration as described in HowToSetupKettleProjectUnderEclipse. 

 # deploy plugin to plugins directory of Kettle (see link [1])
 # add .jar file to kettle project's classpath (run configuration -> classpath) 
 # add .jar file to kettle project's build path 
 # TBD - _currently I am getting error message that breakpoint line couldn't be set_
