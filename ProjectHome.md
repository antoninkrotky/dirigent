The goal of the project is to provide generator for data inetegration projects able to generate:
<li>ELT (ELTL) tranformations</li>
<li>Database object creation scripts</li>
<li>Documentation</li>

The generator will be based on generic metafacede layer so integration with any modelling tool should be easy.

The generator will be integrated with ANT and Pentaho Data Integration (patterns for generation of ELT into PDI jobs will be provided).
